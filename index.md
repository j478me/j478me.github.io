# Jay Machado

I recently obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.

## Past Projects

### [YBRSS Data Analysis](cmsc320.html)

In a class project, a classmate and I used published data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to test the effects of lifestyle choices in survey responses to BMI. We used Python + Pandas on downloaded survey data. The original Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/Wonghopper/Wonghopper.github.io) and the published HTML version is linked in the header.
